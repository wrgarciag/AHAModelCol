This model is part of an AH granted research program that will advance the field of policy IS for CVD by
improving the alignment of the data generation/analysis cycle and the policy cycle in LICs and MICs.
In particular, this is a proof-of-concept decision support tool that links routine data to policy analysis.

Rationale: using routinely collected health data could enhance the accuracy and robustness of modeling
exercises (e.g., cost-effectiveness analyses), but successful examples are lacking. Approach: incorporate
electronic health administrative data into a published hypertension policy model, using automated queries to
continuously update model inputs. Show how this improves upon “static” modeling exercises by comparing
model outputs from both approaches, using the example of hypertension screening policies.
